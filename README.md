# Reinforcement-learning

In the Pendulum system, we consider a simulation of a pendulum and use reinforcement learning to achieve a referece angle of pi/6 with respect to the vertical axis


The RL algorithm is then applied to the kinematic movement of a two wheel differential drive robot to navigate it to a desired location
